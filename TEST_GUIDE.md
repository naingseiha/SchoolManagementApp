# 🎨 CARD DESIGN TEST - BORDERS & SHADOWS

## ✅ What I Added

To help distinguish posts better, I've added:

### Card Styling:
- **Border**: Gray border around each card (`border-gray-200`)
- **Rounded Corners**: 12px radius (`rounded-xl`)
- **Shadow**: Small subtle shadow (`shadow-sm`)
- **Spacing**: 16px between cards (`mb-4`)

### Why These Changes:
You mentioned the light dividers (top/bottom borders) were confusing and posts looked too similar. Adding card borders makes each post clearly distinct and separate.

## 🧪 Test & Compare

**Refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R) and see how it looks!

### Current Design (With Borders):
- ✅ Clear card separation
- ✅ Rounded corners
- ✅ Subtle shadows
- ✅ Each post is distinct
- ✅ Professional card look

### What to Look For:
1. **Readability** - Can you easily tell posts apart?
2. **Visual Appeal** - Does it look clean and modern?
3. **Spacing** - Is the gap between cards good?
4. **Shadows** - Are shadows subtle enough?

## 💡 Your Options

### Option 1: Keep It ✅

### Option 2: Adjust
- Make shadows stronger/weaker
